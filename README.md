# Visual Search Database

This projects aims to create a database for visual search datasets capable of handling theoretically any kind of visual search data. 
The second goal is to create a standard language for the description of such data sets.

## Background

Visual search has a relatively long history and there are gazzilions of experiments done every year. Yet, when Andrey Chetverikov started doing his experiments he was really frustrated because it was quite difficult to find clear answers for seemingly simple questions (e.g., how does the spatial density of distractors interacts with the set size?). On the other hand, other simple questions seem to resurface over and over again as if the data collected before did not exist. We believe that part of the problem is that it is really difficult to find some data collected before you. Even now, when there is a strong movement towards open science, not many people publish their data and it is often pre-processed so that only the authors hypothesis can be tested. Furthermore, a lack of machine-readable meta-data makes reanalysis of previous data a daunting task.
 
We have been working on a database and a standard for visual search experiments data. The idea is that the data should allow to recreate the stimuli display precisely (and include the variables such as ITI that might affect the results). The final version of the project should allow the researchers to upload their data in a typical format (csv) along with a configuration file so that it will be automatically processed and included in the database. Finally, an online interface (Shiny?) should be available to show some of the typical effects known in visual search. Itâ€™s a difficult task, but we had some progress, so that now the data from our own experiments can be imported along with some of the publicly-available sets.

## Current status

The work on the database was on hiatus for a while, but we're trying to restart it. Here are some current stats:

* Papers/sources: 9
* Experiments: 26
* Participants: 351
* Trials: 504003

The demo of a Shiny app using the (cached output from) database is here: https://achetverikov.shinyapps.io/VisualSearchDB/

## Installation

For those who wants to run a database on their own machine - installation guide v0.02.

1. Get your own copy of the project - fork it or just clone it if you have write access.
2. Download & install neo4j from https://neo4j.com/. If you haven't used Neo4j before, install the desktop version (the following points assume you use the desktop version). 
3. Start neo4j. Create a database with version 3.5.x. The name of the database doesn't matter. Set the password.

4. Find out the import path. To do this, go to the database management (click on three dots to the right from the database name at the main screen of Neo4j destop, then "Manage"), click on the arrrow near "Open Folder" and choose import.

5. Copy the path to this folder to `neo4j_import` variable in `import_data/connect_to_neo4j.R`. On MacOS, the path looks something like `/Users/UserName/Library/Application Support/com.Neo4j.Relate/Data/dbmss/dbms-13c3f0ca-ba6d-41ef-ae9e-8d56bc11a574/import/`. 
6. Install APOC plugin from the plugin tab of the database management screen.
7. Set username and password for neo4j also in `import_data/connect_to_neo4j.R`.
8. Open the project (visual_search_db.Rproj) with RStudio or just set the directory to the main directory of the project.
9. You may need to install additional packages: 
```
install.packages(c('devtools','yaml', 'data.table','stringr','digest'))
devtools::install_github('nicolewhite/RNeo4j')
devtools::install_github('thomasp85/patchwork')
devtools::install_github('achetverikov/APAstats')
```
10. Run `source('import_data/parse_config_for_neo4j.R')` 

Voila! In theory, everything should work now. You can test it by running:
```
load_data_neo4j('data/chetverikov_kristjansson_2015','import_conf.yaml')
load_data_neo4j('data/chetverikov_campana_kristjansson_2016','exp1_config.yaml')
```
Both should run without errors, the first one is fast, the second one is slower.
