# This is a configuration file template for data import. Comments start with #, empty strings are ignored.
# Information about maintainer and experiment comes in form of parameter : value pairs, 
# where value is a string (sometimes converted to number by import scripts, as in case of display parameters).
# Required parameters are listed after "required:" string, the ones after "optional:" are optional.
# Information about subjects, blocks, trials, and stimuli also comes in form parameter : value pairs, but value now refer to the column names in the respective files.
# For subjects, blocks, trials, and stimuli there can be different optional fields in addition to the ones listed in the template.
# Stimuli part is optional.
# You may put several values (comma separated) for the parameter
