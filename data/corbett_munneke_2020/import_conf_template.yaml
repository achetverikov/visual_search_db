# This is a configuration file template for data import. Comments start with #, empty strings are ignored.
# Information about the maintainer and the experiment comes in a form of "parameter : value" pairs, 
# where "value" is a string (sometimes converted to numeric format by import scripts, as in case of display parameters).
# Required parameters are listed after "required:" string, the ones after "optional:" are optional.
# Information about subjects, blocks, trials, and stimuli also comes in form parameter : value pairs, 
# but "value" now refers to the column names in the respective files.
# For subjects, blocks, trials, and stimuli there can be different optional fields in addition to the ones listed in the template.
# Stimuli part is optional.
# Put your values instead of our default values or explanations.

Dataset:
    # These parameters describe stimuli properties that are constant within the experiment. 
    # The same parameters can be used for blocks, if they are constant within a block rather than within the experiment, or for trials if they are constant within trials.
    # Put the parameter characteristic under the section, where they vary: Experiment (if they constant over experiment), Block, or Trial.
    # If the parameters were constant during the experiment, write them here. If they varied, write the dataset column names in one of the following sections (i.e., Subject, Block, or Trial)
    
    # Trial-by-trial information about stimuli could be included as a separate file (stimuli_file field).
