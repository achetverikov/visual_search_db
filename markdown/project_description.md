### What is this all about?

This project aims to create a living and growing database of visual search datasets. We hope to:
- consolidate the data from separate studies into a domain-specific repository, making it easier to access both the "big picture" and the indivual studies
- promote better data description standards by developing a flexible machine-readable description template
- facilitate data re-use, so that researchers won't have to collect the same data over and over
- aid computational modeling, so that researchers can test their models using the data from many different labs rather than limiting themselves to specific "exemplary" datasets
- create a foundation for the automated testing of theoretical accounts (through computational models)

On this page you can see an interactive snapshot of the database. This is just to provide a glimpse into the trove of data that is available using some of the relatively well-known visual search effects. To get the actual data, follow the instructions on the project Github page. 

This is a work in progress: there is a lot to do, and a lot to be improved. We hope that this would become a community endeavour, so if you want to add new data, create another interactive demo, or show how your favorite model can describe all the data, please drop a line at andrey.a.chetverikov@gmail.com or just fork the project on Github and start coding.
